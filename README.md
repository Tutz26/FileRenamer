2 - Select the directory which contains the files you want to rename. If you don't see your files there
    don't panic. They are still there, but the dialog won't show them since only shows folders.

3 - Check the files you want to rename;
  [note: FileRenamer only lists files in the selection box to the left, not sub folders]
    You can use "Check All" to check all the items or
    you can use "Uncheck All" to uncheck all the items.
  [note: You will notice in the right side box the names of the checked files]

####  For CHANGING TEXT:

    "Change Text". If there are files that contain this text in their file name, the 
    text you wrote will disappear from the filenames in the right DON'T PANIC!...
